# Book Recommendation & Analysis App

This application provides intelligent book recommendation and analysis features by combining semantic search, classification, and sentiment analysis powered by modern machine learning models.

### ðŸš€ Features
1. Semantic Search
    * Uses `ChromaDB` as a vector database.
    * Employs `OpenAI Embeddings` to represent book descriptions in vector space.
    * Enables efficient semantic similarity search, so users can find books based on meaning rather than exact keywords.

2. Book Classification (Fiction vs Non-Fiction)
    * Implements `zero-shot` classification using the pre-trained `facebook/bart-large-mnli` model from Hugging Face.
    * Classifies books into Fiction or Non-Fiction categories, even without explicit labels in the dataset.

3. Sentiment & Emotion Analysis
    * Leverages the fine-tuned open-source model j-hartmann/emotion-english-distilroberta-base from Hugging Face.
    * Analyzes book descriptions to determine the dominant sentiment/emotion.
    * Supports multiple emotion classes, including joy, sadness, anger, fear, surprise, disgust, and neutral.

### ðŸ“Œ Use Cases
* ðŸ“š Book Recommendation: Find similar books to what you like.
* ðŸ§  Reader Insight: Understand the emotions conveyed in books.
* ðŸŽ­ Categorization: Automatically sort books into Fiction vs Non-Fiction.
